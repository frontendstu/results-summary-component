## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content (one day ðŸ¤­)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I followed along with Kevin Powell's video [From Design to Code // HTML & CSS from scratch // Frontend Mentor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqFAs5d3Yl8) on YouTube.

### Continued development

At a later stage I will revisit this project, convert it to Sass and actually attempt the bonus objective of pulling in local JSON data.
